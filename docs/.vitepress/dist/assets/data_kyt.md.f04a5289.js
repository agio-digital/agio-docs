This includes features such as monitoring for transactions with blacklisted addresses, identifying unusual or high-risk activity, and generating reports for regulatory bodies. KYT helps businesses and individuals ensure that their cryptocurrency transactions, such as funds received during an ITO, are in line with relevant regulations and standards.
