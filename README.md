## VitePress

VitePress is [VuePress](https://vuepress.vuejs.org)' spiritual successor, built on top of [vite](https://github.com/vitejs/vite).

Currently, it's in the `alpha` stage. It is already suitable for out-of-the-box documentation use, but the config and theming API may still change between minor releases.

## Documentation
